# data-portfolio

:wave: Welcome to my data repo! Here's the best place to discover my progress in learning data-related skills.

### Projects list

* Transport for London Accident Statistics [Ongoing]
* Bioinformatics: Steryl-Sulfate Enzyme Activities [Ongoing]
* K-Pop album sales (web scraping)


## Transport for London (TfL) Accident Statistics :rotating_light:

### About the Project

Have you wondered how well the road-based transportation doing in London, given 4700 sets of traffic signal located throughout the whole city and the effectiveness of public transport networks? I do. I decided to visit Tfl API site to discover any relevant information that could help me to picture the answer. With the help of requests library, I managed to pull about 200,000 accidents information dated from 2016 to 2019 that includes a total around 250,000 casualties and 370,000 vehicles.  

Rather than making this project with one specific goal, I view this as an open project which allows to maximise my data learning by exploring many different skills e.g. visualizations, database, modelling. My first goal is to create a visualization via a BI tool, in which I choose to use Microsoft PowerBI. I am also working on data visualization via Tableau. My next goals are to create a BigQuery database and also to come up with a suitable machine learning problem.

## Bioinformatics: Steryl-Sulfate Enzyme Activities :snowflake:

### About the Project

My eagerness in finding examples of a perfect beginner, end-to-end data science project has led me to watching YouTube tutorials from freeCodeCamp.org. Fortunately, I found [Data Professor's tutorial](https://youtu.be/jBlTQjcKuaY) on a bioinformatic project. This project is my attempt to follow the tutorial with different choice of dataset. The source is Chembl Database which also one of the main database for biological and chemical molecules. I have chosen to investigate the bioactivity data of steryl sulfate that responsible for a severe skin disease. As a patient of eczema, I am curious how do scientists work on finding the cure/medication for dermatological conditions.

Unfortunately, this project is yet to complete. I stuck in calling functions from rdkit. Many attempts to resolve this issue have been made including the suggestions from the repo's forum and also from StackExchange. I'm working on replicating the functions I needed from the package.

## K-Pop album sales :cd:

### About the Project

This project entails my first experience in web scraping using Python's package Beautiful Soup. My interest in K-Pop has made me wonder how much does the K-Pop artists/labels made from their album sales.
